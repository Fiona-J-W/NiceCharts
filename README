A Small inkscape extension to draw charts in inkscape by Christoph Sterz and Florian Weber.

The next version of inkscape will contain NiceCharts by default and the further development
has also been passed on to the inkscape-project. This means that it will likely be a good idea to
contact the inkscape-team, for instance via @Moini who initiated that inclusion.

For installation simply copy the 3 files into your Inkscape extension folder
eg. in /usr/share/inkscape/extensions/

After installing, you may find it in Inkscape menu Extensions > Render > NiceCharts. 

NiceCharts is a free software. Its license is GNU GPL 3 or later.
